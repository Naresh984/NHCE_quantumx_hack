EMUW is a device which stands for Economical management and uses of water.
This device maintains the water level in the paddy fields.

## Working
 
So whenever the water gets pumped into the field the Sensor 1 will detect the water level according to the crop and stops the flow of water into the field.
In a similar mechanism we have placed another sensor just above the Sensor 1 so to pump out the excess of water.   


## Features

- Huge amount of water gets saved.
- Rainwater harvesting is also done.
- Easy to use through the GUI.
- Yield of the crop can increase upto 30%.
